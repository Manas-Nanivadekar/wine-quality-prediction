# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains a simple machine learning project built using the [Red Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) by Cortez et al. (2009). The goal of this project is to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical features using supervised learning techniques.
